CoffeeBuddy is a web app that will help you brew the perfect cup of coffee with your preferred manual brew method.

Input your desired fluid ounces of final brew, and coffeeBuddy will display a recipe to use.

Brew ratio can be tweaked, and recipes can be saved in local storage for reference and re-use.

I built coffeeBuddy in 2016 as part of the entrace exam to CodeFellows developer bootcamp, and it was the first website I ever made!
