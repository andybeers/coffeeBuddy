		<h2>What's a brew ratio?</h2>
		<p class="ratioP">A brew ratio is a simple way to express the strength, or concentration, of our brewed coffee using two numbers separated by a colon: parts coffee to parts water (by weight).</p>
		<p class="ratioP">For example, if we make a cup of coffee using a <b>1:16</b> ratio, that means that for every 1 part coffee we use 16 parts water. A stronger cup would use a "tighter" ratio, in which we use less water for each part coffee (<b>1:14</b>, for example).</p>
		<p class="ratioP">The coffeeBuddy default brew ratio is <b>1:16</b>, which is a great starting point for your brews. Common brew ratios range from <b>1:14</b> to as wide as <b>1:20</b></p>
		<p class="ratioP">coffeeBuddy calculations account for water absorbed by the coffee grounds.</p>
